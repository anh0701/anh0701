- 👋 Hi, I’m Anh, a backend developer with 1 year of experience coding in Spring Boot.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, software architecture, and test automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build Web APIs using Spring Boot/Laravel, microservices architecture, and automation testing.
- 📄 I share my code snippets and technical notes on GitHub Gist: [**My Gists**](https://gist.github.com/anh0701)
- 💻 I'm currently working on a project here: [**s13e**](https://github.com/s13e-org)
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on backend systems, automation testing, or scalable web services.
